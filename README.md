# cve-analysis
Tools for conducting analysis of CVE data in Elasticsearch

## Quckstart:
These insructions aren't good. I'll make this all easier someday.

Use the mapping.json to create your elasticsearch index
Run get-cve.sh
Run update-es.sh

You should be good to go. There is also a script to populate the MITRE CVE
data, but I found the NVD data was vastly superior.
