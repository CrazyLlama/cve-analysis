# cve-analysis
Tools for conducting analysis of CVE data in Elasticsearch

## Quckstart:
Download Elasticsearch and Kibana from elastic.co  
The latest versions are fine.

Start them (see the quickstart guide if you don't know how)

Add the mapping.json file to Elasticsearch  
`curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/cve-index?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @mapping.json`

Run get-cve.sh to download the CVE data from NVD  
Run update-es.sh to import the CVE data into Elasticsearch

You rerun the above commands to update your data whenever needed.

Now navigate your web browser to http://localhost:5601

Mining this data will be covered in a blog post
